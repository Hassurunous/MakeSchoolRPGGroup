# MakeSchoolRPGGroup

#Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to allow a place for all of the members of the Make School RPG Group to host resources that either a) relate to their character (such as character images, backstory they want to share...etc.), b) they feel the other players might find useful to their enjoyment of the game, or c) I distribute to the group for public access (such as notes that you find on bad guys and such). I will also likely maintain a presence on Roll20.net, an RPG playing site, which I will probably use to display maps and other data, as much of mine is digital.

That being said, this space if your you guys! Feel free to add anything here that other player's characters would be aware of, but try to keep anything I share with you privately (such as a secret only your character knows) off of the public repo, at least until such time that your character shares that information with the group. 

Most importantly, I hope you all have fun!
